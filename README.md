# Bank Customer-Churn-Analysis-Project📊

## Project Objective📌

The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn behavior in a banking environment and identify key factors influencing customer exit. The dashboard aims to help stakeholders understand churn patterns across customer demographics, financial attributes, and engagement levels to support targeted retention strategies.

## Dataset Used 📈

The project utilizes a customer-level banking dataset containing 10,000 customer records, including attributes such as age, gender, geography, balance, credit score, tenure, product count, credit card ownership, activity status, salary, and churn flag (Exited). Data was cleaned, validated, and modeled using SQL and Power BI to ensure accurate churn analysis.

Higher churn was observed among customers with 1–2 products and inactive accounts.
Certain geographic regions showed a noticeably higher concentration of churned customers.
Customers with lower tenure and specific balance ranges exhibited increased churn risk.

## Final Conclusion 🎖️
